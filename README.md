# quickstart-vim-go

_Quickstart vim to use customized functionality for golang_

---

### Usage

##### Download
```
go get -d github.com/rigelrozanski/quickstart-vim-go
```

##### Installation
This tool will generate a new `.vimrc` file, but first you have to do [this][1] setup
Pathogen, vim-go, neocomplete, molokai theme, tagbar, and nerdtree, should be installed with the 
given link before running this installation. Additionally, I recommend that you install [go-def][4].
Once you've run through the tutorial you use:  
```
make install
```

##### Updating from this repo's custom vimrc
The custom `vimrc` file can be manually changed from this repo and updated in `~/.vimrc` with the
following command:
```
make update
```

##### Updating the custom vimrc from existing vimrc
As a reverse from the above command, the  `~/.vimrc` can update this repo's local `vimrc` with
```
make pull 
```
